# About

This is my first React project.

I developed a simple static website where I brushed up on my HTML and CSS skills.

I had some problems publishing the React project on Github pages, but with the help of this [tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/deploying-react-apps-github-pages/), I finally succeeded.
